# PASS Time Carry Music
Plays a different theme depending on whether RED or BLU is holding the ball in PASS Time.

Music plays from the ball itself, and remains active when thrown until it turns neutral, so passing to teammates will have the music flying across the map.

The songs used are the Benny Hill running theme for BLU, and the Jackass theme for RED - these are ripped from Unreal Tournament's Bombing Run mode, from which this plugin was inspired. The songs are a minute long each, but do not loop. If you're holding the ball for that long, though, are you even playing the game at that point?
